windows_vm_monitor

Instruction
-----------------
This a simple windows vm monitor, which uses an exe file as agent to transfer guest system's mem, disk and other status
info to a monitor server running in the host system.
The exe agent(stored in the client dir) is written in autoit, you can compile it into exe file, and put it into the guest system. The agent was
tested only on windows xp, I do not known is there any problems when it is running on other windows platform.
The monitor server(stored in the server dir) is a simple script written in python, it will write guest system's status into a sqlite db.
