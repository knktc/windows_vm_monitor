windows_vm_monitor

Instruction
-----------------
This a simple windows vm monitor, which uses an exe file as agent to transfer guest system's mem, disk and other status
info to a monitor server running in the host system.
The exe agent(stored in the client dir) is written in autoit, you can compile it into exe file, and put it into the guest system. The agent was
tested only on windows xp, I do not known is there any problems when it is running on other windows platform.
The monitor server(stored in the server dir) is a simple script written in python, it will write guest system's status into a sqlite db.


installation
-----------------
*Server
The server part can be running on any os with a python environment. You should put the server dir to anywhere you'd like
to and modify the config.ini file.
A config.ini file in the server dir may be like this:

    [server]
    server_ip=192.168.11.55
    server_port=8001
    max_conn=10
    conn_timeout=5
    buffer_size=1024
    db_file=host_status.s3db
    table_name=t_status

server_ip: Current system's ip. You should get it with ipconfig or ifconfig command. If the VMs are running on this host
           with NAT mode, this ip should be the VMs' gateway ip.(If you are using KVM, the ip should be 192.168.122.1)
server_port: the listening port of this server
max_conn: max client count
conn_timeout: timeout when the clients are trying to connect the server
buffer_size: use this default value
db_file: the default sqlite db file name, this file can be find in the server dir
table_name: the default table name in the db file

**Client
The client part is only working on windows platform. You should compile the kvm_monitor_client.au3 file to a single exe
file, and distribute it with the config.ini file. The config.ini file in the Clinet dir may be like this:

    [client]
    first_run=0
    domain_name=test_domain
    disk_path=c:
    server_ip=192.168.11.55
    server_port=8001
    buffer_size=1024
    program_name=notepad

first_run: set this flag to 1 after you distribute the client into VMs, this will cause the server side to perform an
           "insert" action for the new add VMs
domain_name: the names of VMs
disk_path: this client will return the disk usage status, you can specify the disk drive you want to check
server_ip: keep the same as the config.ini file in the server side
server_port: keep the same as the config.ini file in the server side
buffer_size: keep the same as the config.ini file in the server side
program_name: this client will check running programs by checking the windows title, you should seperated multiple
              programs by using "|"
